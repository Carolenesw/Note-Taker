## User Story 

* AS a user, I want to be able to write, save and delete notes to allow me to organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Technology

- Nodejs
- Express
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Description: 

* For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

* The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 
* Create and pass all unit tests. 
* When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

* The application should be albe to do the following: 
    ** allow users to create and save notes.
    ** allow users to view previously saved notes.
    ** allow users to delete previously saved notes.
